\mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceLepton}{Lepton}} (\char`\"{}lightweight expression parser\char`\"{}) is a small C++ library for parsing, evaluating, differentiating, and analyzing mathematical expressions. For more information refer to \href{https://simtk.org/projects/lepton}{\texttt{ https\+://simtk.\+org/projects/lepton}}.

The source code author is Peter Eastman from Stanford University. Here we only provide CMake scripts in order to make the compilation straightforward.

The compilation step-\/by-\/step is taken as follows\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Clone the repository cointaining \mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceLepton}{Lepton}} and its dependencies
\end{DoxyEnumerate}


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{git clone https://github.com/rdinizcal/lepton}

\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Then, create and enter build folder 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd lepton}

\end{DoxyCode}
 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{mkdir build \&\& cd build}

\end{DoxyCode}

\item Execute cmake from the build folder 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake ..}

\end{DoxyCode}

\item Finally, compile and install lepton library 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo make install}

\end{DoxyCode}
 
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
